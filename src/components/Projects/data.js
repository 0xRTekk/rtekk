      "Fullstack Developer for a Stock Management Application for the Agricultural Cooperative CAMPA. CAMPA is an agricultural cooperative bringing together stakeholders across France and Belgium.

Additionally, an automatic reminder system was implemented to prompt managers to declare their inventory in a timely manner.",
